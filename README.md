# WK Show Review SRS Level

A userscript to display the current SRS Level of a review item on WaniKani. For everyone's sanity I've chosen to adopt the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Have fun!

## Credits

Special thanks to rfindley (Robin Findley) whose [Lightning Mode](https://community.wanikani.com/t/UserScript-WaniKani-Lightning-Mode/10201/28) script provided the base for css.
General design was taken from 'ruipgpinheiro (LordGravewish)' whose original script ['WaniKani Show Level'](https://community.wanikani.com/t/Wanikani-Show-Level-101-Shows-SRS-level-during-reviews-No-longer-supported/3882) is missing to the best of my knowledge, motivating me to create this one.
Finally, thanks to hoovard's [KunOn+ script](https://community.wanikani.com/t/New-version-of-KunOn-script-WK-Custom-Review-Question-KunOn/7597) for saving me the headache of finding the right storage key.
